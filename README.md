Hello, my name is Matthew!

### Programming

I have the most experience with Java, but I do leverage Kotlin, C#, and C++ as well depending on the project.

### Education Summary

I am currently in UIUC as a freshman, and am planning to transfer into either CS or a different CS heavy major. I am a CA for CS 124, and currently am wanting to get into GPU accelerated VFX simulation, as well as applications to improve productity and acceessibility for those with disabilities in academia, as well as making it easier to keep track of important data such as sleep logs.

### Interests

I like programming as a hobby from time to time, but I also have a vested interest in game development; where I have used Unity and now switched to Unreal Engine 5. I have been 3D modelling for over a year, and have been mostly focusing in procedural geometry, gas simulations, and hard surface modelling. I currently use:

>Rendering, Main Software: E-Cycles (Blender)

>Texturing: Substance Painter, Quixel Mixer

>Simulation: EmberGen, VectorRayGen, Mantaflow

>Post: Photoshop (Stills), Premiere Pro (Video)

>Hard Surface Addons: Boxcutter, Hard-Ops, Decalmachine, BY-GEN, Cablerator

If anyone is interested in doing any collaborative projects for either my academic or artistic interests, let me know!

### Previous Work Experience

I worked for 3 years at a non-profit charity organization affiliated with SEDOL (The Special Education District of Lake County) as an IT person, who managed domain and hosting infrastructure and budgeting, as well as training for organization members to be able to handle updates, direct contact for inquiries, and handling contacting members.

I worked with an artist to create a storefront to sell their commissions, pre-made, and custom items. I handled the integration from the on-demand printing service and Magento, handled the payment authorization, managed email, hosting, and domain adminisstration, and handled the rollout of new products.

### Contact Me

Please DM me on Artstation for art or commission based requests! It is not a full repository of all artwork I have completed, let me know if you would like to see my more recent works.
